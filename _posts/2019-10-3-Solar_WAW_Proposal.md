I will be riding in The Lyon-Canton Sun Trip 2020 and I'm building a solar velomobile for the journey. The smooth asphalt of the new silk road should allow a velomobile to travel at a high speed safely and consistently.
To this end, I'm developing a tilting solar p.v. array that is lightweight and low drag. 

The solar array pivots around a single carbon fiber tube, supported by struts with aerofoil sections for minimal additional drag. The main support will couple to the WAW's rear bulkhead, joining the rear suspension mount (potential for additional support in the front if needed).

The 144 cell, (0.81x3.1m ~= 2.5m^2) solar array will be mounted 1.4m above the ground, giving the pilot an unobstructed view and increasing the visibility of the velo to other road users since its height will be comparable to a typical car roof.Â  
The array can tilt to a maximum of 80 degrees from horizontal, giving it a minimum projection error of cos(10) = 0.98, capturing up to 98% of the available solar flux when riding tangentially to the sun.The array will weigh approximately 6kg, which should be light enough to maintain a stable, low centre of mass. 
The height could be reduced if it seems unstable, though the single pivot design places a restriction, compared to this [dual pivot solar velomobile](https://solarvelomobile.wordpress.com/) that achieves a lower mounting height.

The tilting mechanism must have a high enough holding torque to resist wind loading, but be able to slip in a crash condition.

Dual front hub motors (Grin All Axle) if possible? Requires disk brake calipers.

Use a WAW Velomobile, with rear suspension and chunky touring tyres.
