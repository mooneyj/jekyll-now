title: Silk Road Runner

I will be riding in The Lyon-Canton Sun Trip 2020 and I'm building a solar velomobile for the journey. The smooth asphalt of the new silk road should allow a velomobile to travel at a high speed safely and consistently.
To this end, I'm developing a tilting solar p.v. array that is lightweight and low drag. 

The solar array pivots around a single carbon fiber tube, supported by struts with aerofoil sections for minimal additional drag. The main support will couple to the WAW's rear bulkhead, joining the rear suspension mount (potential for additional support in the front if needed).

The 144 cell, (0.81x3.1m ~= 2.5m^2) solar array will be mounted 1.4m above the ground, giving the pilot an unobstructed view and increasing the visibility of the velo to other road users since its height will be comparable to a typical car roof.Â  
The array can tilt to a maximum of 80 degrees from horizontal, giving it a minimum projection error of cos(10) = 0.98, capturing up to 98% of the available solar flux when riding tangentially to the sun. The array will weigh approximately 7kg, which should be light enough to maintain a stable, low centre of mass. 
The height could be reduced by about 20cm if it seems unstable, though the single pivot design places a restriction, compared to this [dual pivot solar velomobile](https://solarvelomobile.wordpress.com/) that achieves a shorter mounting height.

The tilting mechanism must have a high enough holding torque to resist wind loading, but be able to slip in a crash condition.

For mounting struts use [EPPLER 863 STRUT AIRFOIL](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=e863-il), as they have low drag even at high angle of attack. 3D print airfoil sections, with internal carbon spar and woven carbon wrap.

### Solar Panels
Raf Van Hulle used 1mm aluminium backed solar panels made by Soltech, with Sunpower Maxeon gen3 cells. The aluminium backing is quite heavy compared to a foam or honeycomb design, however it provides superior cooling and uniform temperature distribution.
Is the extra weight worth the improved thermal performance? 


Dual front hub motors (Grin All Axle) if possible? Requires disk brake calipers.

Use a WAW Velomobile, with rear suspension and chunky touring tyres.
