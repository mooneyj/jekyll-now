J'ai été accepté dans le Sun Trip 2020!

In May 2020, I will set off alongside 70 other riders, to ride the  silk road with our solar electric cycles, riding from Lyon to Guangzhou ~12,000km away. 
The fastest fossil-free silk road crossing was set by Raf Van Hulle in 2018, who completed the journey in 45 days, averaging 30km/h for about 10 hours per day. This amazing feat was made possible by the combination of his calm and determined character with an amazing bicycle: The Solarwind.

His solar array is basically maxed out in performance (within the competition regulations of 2.5m^2 pv area).
The bike is very light, coming in at 55kg including his luggage.
The air resistance is helped by the use of aerobars.

My strategy is to use a velomobile, a tricycle with an aerodynamic shell (monocoque construction). 
This vehicle will be heavier by around 10-15kg, reducing its mountain climbing performance, however its air resistance will be reduced, resulting in significantly lower average power requirements during cruise.

When riding on smooth relatively flat or descending road the velomobile should outperfrom an upright bike platform.
However, riding across a continent presents a diverse array of challenges, including mountainous terrain and traffic filled cities. In these environments an upright bike provides greater visibility and therefore the ability to negotiate traffic safely, smoothly and therefore speedily. It remains to be seen how the velomobile will perform in such sections. 
Another factor is comfort, arguably the velomobile offers superior physical comfort with its laid back riding position, distributing the weight of the body over a larger surface area. However the reduced visibility of being low down, and with a solar roof above could be a source of mental frustration. (Which is why I'd like to make the roof quite far above my head)

Inevitable, but complex, chaotic challenge. I will race hard, but without loosing sight of the commaradery of the trip; what a pleasure it will be to ride with so many other solar riders!
One thing is for certain, the sun will not always shine. At these times speed is purely determined by riders mind and body. 
I must train.

I dream of riding the silk road to experience Eurasia as a harmonious whole and inspire people along the way with the potential of fossil-free mobility.
The smooth asphalt of the new silk road opens up the possibility of riding a highly efficient solar velomobile at high average speed and relative comfort.

I find the concept of a solar velomobile supremely beautiful and I want to bring my vision of one into existence. To achieve this I will use 3D printing combined with carbon composite to create a tilting streamlined solar array above a commercially available velomobile platform. 

The combination of design, technology and adventure makes the sun trip my ideal project.
